# Loan Prediction Problem
We used machine learning algorithms to predict whether a person should get a loan or not. We used SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification to see the difference results. For evalutaion we used different metrics such as precision score, recall score and F1 score to understand better. And finally, we integrated this project as a web application. 
-All the information you need about the project you can find it in the final report.
